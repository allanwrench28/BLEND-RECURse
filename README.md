## 🎯 **What is GHST?**

GHST is a revolutionary AI-driven coding ecosystem featuring:

1. **AI-First Development**: Multiple specialized AI agents (GHSTs/Ghosts) autonomously code, debug, and optimize
2. **Council-Driven Architecture**: 500+ PhD-level AI personas collaborate through councils and think tanks
3. **Universal Programming Interface (UPI)**: Meta-framework integrating languages, tools, and APIs dynamically
4. **Self-Healing & Recursive**: Agents learn, adapt, and improve the system continuously
5. **FOSS Ethos**: Fully open-source with no gatekeeping, transparent and ethical

### **Core Applications**

- **FANTOM**: AI-driven 3D printing slicer with ghost automation
- **Recur Framework**: Council-driven automation and learning system  
- **Terminal UI**: Grok-inspired polished interfaces
- **Branch Management**: Themed GHSTs managing specialized development branches
