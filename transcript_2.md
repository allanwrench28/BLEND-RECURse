**User:**  
Ok thanks I'm gonna go grab more chunks:

Yeah that's the other thing, let's make this API ethical but unbiased as possible idk if there's a way to make the hardcoded LLM implement this like I want the machine to look at data from a total factual and objective basis from all sides, we want the closest to the truth we can get, I want that to be the core tenant using multiple peer reviewed sources and courses and knowledge base information from credible sources, teachers professors university studies, fbi statistics etc that hold merit

**GHST:**  
Here’s a structured summary and actionable plan for integrating an **ethical, unbiased, fact-based core** into your GHST API and system:

---

## GHST API: Ethical & Unbiased Core Tenets

**Mission:**  
Ensure all outputs, recommendations, and knowledge fragments delivered by GHST agents are grounded in objective, verified, and peer-reviewed information, striving for maximum factual accuracy and minimal bias.

---

### 1. **Core Principles**

- **Objectivity:**  
  Always present information from multiple credible perspectives.  
  Avoid injecting opinion, speculation, or unverified assertions.

- **Source Quality:**  
  Prioritize data from:
    - Peer-reviewed journals and academic studies
    - Official statistics (e.g., FBI, CDC, UN)
    - University research
    - Credible educational materials (courses, textbooks)
    - Recognized authorities (professors, experts)

- **Transparency:**  
  Clearly cite sources for every major output or recommendation.  
  When possible, provide direct links to the source or publication.

- **Diversity of Perspectives:**  
  Present multiple sides, especially on contentious topics, with factual support for each.

- **Continuous Peer Review:**  
  Encourage ongoing community fact-checking and flagging of outdated or questionable information.

---

### 2. **Implementation Plan**

#### a. **Data Ingestion & Validation**
- Integrate modules that pull from trusted APIs (e.g., arXiv, PubMed, government databases).
- When ingesting new knowledge, tag it with source, publication date, and credibility score.

#### b. **LLM Output Filtering**
- Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):  
  When answering or summarizing, always reference a pool of cited, factual documents.
- Implement a “fact-check wrapper”:  
  Before final output, cross-reference responses against established datasets and flag discrepancies.

#### c. **Citation System**
- Each GHST response includes:
  - Source list (title, author, publication, date, link)
  - Credibility score or peer review status

#### d. **Bias Mitigation**
- Use multiple LLM models with different training sets to compare outputs and reduce single-model bias.
- Explicitly log areas where consensus is not reached and present all credible sides.

#### e. **Ethics Module**
- Add an “Ethics Core” to the API, with guidelines on privacy, data handling, and neutrality.
- Provide opt-in/opt-out flags for sensitive topics or regions.

#### f. **Community Review**
- Allow users and contributors to flag, annotate, or suggest improvements to factual fragments.
- Periodically audit outputs using volunteer academics, teachers, and professionals.

```json
{
  "question": "What are the safest cities in the US?",
  "answer": [
    "According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program (2024), the cities with the lowest violent crime rates per capita include...",
    "A 2023 study in the Journal of Urban Studies supports these findings, noting..."
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "FBI Crime Data Explorer",

    },
    {
      "title": "Urban Safety in America",
      "author": "Dr. Jane Smith",
      "journal": "Journal of Urban Studies",
      "date": "2023",
      "type": "peer-reviewed"
    }

  "reviewed_by": ["Prof. John Doe (NYU)", "Community peer review (May 2025)"]
}
```

### 4. **Codebase Recommendations**

- **modules/objectivity.py:**  
  Handles output filtering, cross-referencing, and citation formatting.
- **data_sources/peers/**  
  Contains connectors to academic, statistical, and government data feeds.
- **ethics/neutrality_checker.py:**  
  Flags potential bias, logs contentious responses, and ensures multi-source presentation.
- **docs/ETHICS.md:**  
  Outlines these principles for contributors and users.

---

### 5. **License & Community Guidance**

- Clearly state these ethics and neutrality standards in your README, LICENSE, and contributor docs.
- Encourage community contributions to improve objectivity and source diversity.

**User:**  
Also if the GHST API needs to scrub blogs IE Reddit, X, Facebook, Car troubleshooting sites, etc, for complex problems where credible sources are copywrite or not able to be used for the API please try to ignore any political views and rambling about the non issue(filter it,for the specific keyword and then  start reading context from around the keyboard to avoid buffering or lagging and to avoid bias from infecting the src code

**GHST:**  
Here’s a clear, actionable guideline for how the GHST API should handle scrubbing data from blogs, forums, and social sites when solving complex problems and credible sources are unavailable or restricted:

---

## GHST API: Blog & Forum Scrubbing Protocol

**Objective:**  
Extract useful, fact-based information for complex problems from user-generated content (Reddit, X, Facebook, car forums, etc.) while strictly filtering out political views, off-topic rambling, and any bias that could affect the code or results.

---

### 1. **Keyword-Driven Extraction**
- Scan posts for the specific keywords related to the user’s query or problem.
- Begin reading context just before and after the keyword to capture relevant details.
- Ignore large blocks of text not containing or closely related to the keyword.

### 2. **Bias & Off-Topic Filtering**
- Actively suppress and discard:
  - Political opinions or arguments
  - Personal anecdotes not directly relevant to the technical problem
  - Off-topic discussions, jokes, or rants
- Use content filters and context windows to isolate factual, solution-oriented information.

### 3. **Buffering & Performance**
- Limit context extraction to small, focused windows around the keyword to avoid lag and unnecessary data processing.
- Use efficient text parsing algorithms to prevent buffer overruns and delays.

### 4. **Source Credibility and Annotation**
- Clearly annotate when information is sourced from blogs/forums and not peer-reviewed or official documentation.
- Mark extracted content as "community advice" and note potential reliability issues.

### 5. **No Incorporation of Bias**
- Never allow off-topic, biased, or politicized content to influence the codebase, recommendations, or outputs.
- If a topic is contentious, present only factual, directly relevant information, and clearly state the data’s origin and context.

### 6. **Code Example (Pseudocode)**
```python
def scrub_forum_content(text, keyword):
    # Find keyword and extract context window
    idx = text.lower().find(keyword.lower())
    if idx == -1:
        return None
    # Extract 100 chars before/after keyword for context
    start = max(0, idx - 100)
    end = min(len(text), idx + 100)
    context = text[start:end]
    # Filter out political/off-topic/bias using regex or ML
    context = filter_bias_and_offtopic(context)
    return context
```

### 7. **Documentation**
- Add this protocol to `docs/ETHICS.md` and `docs/DATA_SCRUBBING.md`.
- Make it clear in your API documentation that community-sourced data is filtered for objectivity and technical relevance only.
