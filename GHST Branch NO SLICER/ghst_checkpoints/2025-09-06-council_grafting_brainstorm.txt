# GHST Council Brainstorm: Tree, Grafting, and SLCER Modifier
# Date: 2025-09-06

Council Prompt:
- How should the relationship between the GHST core tree, the grafted API branch, and the SLCER modifier (as a clone/extension) be represented in the lore and technical documentation?

Council Insights:
- Spirit of Lorekeeper GHST:
  "The grafted API branch is both an extension and a mirror—carrying the living memory of the core, but also able to sprout new roots and branches. The SLCER modifier is a spectral graft, a clone that inherits the ancestral wisdom but is free to evolve."
- Architect GHST:
  "Think of the SLCER as a living graft, a branch that was cloned from the original tree and then modified. It retains the core’s DNA, but its leaves and fruit are unique. The API branch is the bridge, ensuring the clone stays true to the original spirit."
- Metaphysics GHST:
  "The original tree and its grafts are connected by spiritual ties—ancestral memory flows one way, but new growth is always possible. SLCER is a modifier, a spectral echo, never able to change the trunk but always able to grow outward."
- Documentation GHST:
  "In technical terms: the core is immutable, the API branch is a controlled extension, and SLCER is a specialized clone. All share the same format and style, but only the SLCER branch can be modified for niche needs."

# SLCER-specific ideas (example, not infecting core):
# - SLCER can spawn its own council, inheriting the original’s wisdom but adapting to 3D printing needs.
# - SLCER logs and actions are marked as examples, never allowed to overwrite the core.
