# Hint for large binary files in docs/external_docs â€” suggest LFS usage.
# If you use Git LFS, run: git lfs install && git lfs track "docs/external_docs/*.pdf"
docs/external_docs/*.pdf filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
docs/external_docs/*.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Keep this file tracked; it informs collaborators how to treat large binaries.
