## 💡 **Key Insights**

### What's Working Well
1. ✅ Comprehensive planning and documentation
2. ✅ Clear phase structure and milestones
3. ✅ Systematic approach to cleanup
4. ✅ Good progress tracking

### Challenges Identified
1. ⚠️ 20+ duplicate filenames need consolidation
2. ⚠️ Multiple release versions (disk space usage)
3. ⚠️ Linting has not yet been run
4. ⚠️ Architecture documentation not yet created

### Recommendations
1. 💡 Prioritize architecture documentation (Week 2-3)
2. 💡 Run linting early to identify issues
3. 💡 Start CI/CD setup in Week 3
4. 💡 Consider moving old releases to git tags

1. Address duplicate filenames
2. Run initial linting
3. Fix critical linting errors
4. Begin architecture documentation

### Priority 2: Prepare for Week 3
1. Draft development environment setup scripts
2. Plan CI/CD improvements
3. Design testing framework structure
4. Identify key areas for documentation
