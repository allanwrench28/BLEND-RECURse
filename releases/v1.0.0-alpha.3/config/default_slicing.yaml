_disclaimer:
  experimental_notice: Experimental features may cause print failures or damage
  liability: SlicerGPT assumes no liability for print quality or failures
  verification: Always preview and verify sliced output before printing
  warning: AI-optimized slicing settings - use at your own risk
_safety_notes:
- Enable developer mode for experimental features
- Non-planar slicing requires compatible printer
- AI optimizations may produce unexpected results
- Always verify G-code output before printing
- Monitor first layer and initial print progress
