## 2. Plan for Dynamic API Integration

### 2.1 Objective
Replace hardcoded LLM integrations with a dynamic API selection mechanism. This ensures flexibility, modularity, and user control over the APIs used for handling conversations and managing branch-specific tasks.

### 2.2 Core Responsibilities

#### Dynamic API Selection
- Provide a terminal-based interface for users to select an API.
- Allow users to input custom API endpoints.
- Validate the selected API for compatibility and functionality.

#### Conversation Handling
- Route all user interactions through the dynamically selected API.
- Use branch-specific prompts to tailor responses.

#### Branch Orchestration
- Dynamically manage branch-specific tasks, frameworks, and data.
- Ensure seamless communication between branches and the main app.

#### Task Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks like merging, distilling data, and generating frameworks.
- Provide suggestions and insights for branch managers.

### 2.3 Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Develop the API Selector
- **Action**: Create a terminal-based interface for API selection.
- **Logic**: Include predefined options and a custom input field for user-defined APIs.

#### Step 2: Validate API Selection
- **Action**: Implement validation logic to ensure the selected API is functional.
- **Logic**: Test the API endpoint for connectivity and compatibility.

#### Step 3: Modular Integration
- **Action**: Design the system to load APIs dynamically based on user input.
- **Logic**: Use APIs or direct model calls to interact with the app's core.

#### Step 4: Conversation Handling
- **Action**: Route all user interactions through the selected API.
- **Logic**: Use branch-specific prompts to tailor responses.

#### Step 5: Ethical and Legal Compliance
- **Action**: Ensure no proprietary information is hardcoded or used.
- **Logic**: Use open-source data and prompts. Document all integrations and ensure transparency.

### 2.4 Deliverables
- **Dynamic API Selector**: A terminal-based interface for selecting and validating APIs.
- **Integrated API System**: A modular and open-source integration for handling conversations and branch orchestration.
- **Ethical and Transparent Implementation**: No proprietary information or hardcoding.
- **Dynamic Branch Management**: Real-time orchestration of branch-specific tasks.

### 2.5 Next Steps
- **Develop the API Selector**: Implement the terminal-based interface.
- **Test and Validate**: Ensure the dynamic API integration is seamless and adheres to open-source principles.
- **Refine and Document**: Update documentation to reflect the dynamic approach.

## 3. Plan for AUTOMoE Integration

### 3.1 Objective
Integrate AUTOMoE (Automatic Mixture of Experts) to dynamically select and utilize GHSTs based on user preferences and automation levels.

### 3.2 Core Responsibilities

#### AUTOMoE System
- Dynamically select GHSTs from the pool based on the mode set by the `SpeedbuildSlider`.
- Modes:
  - **Speedbuild**: Fully automated GHST selection.
  - **Personalized**: User-driven GHST selection.
  - **Mixed**: A combination of automated and user-driven selection.

#### Integration with SpeedbuildSlider
- Connect the `SpeedbuildSlider` widget to the AUTOMoE system.
- Use the slider's `get_mode` method to determine the selection strategy.

#### Dynamic Adaptation
- Ensure AUTOMoE dynamically adapts to changes in the slider's mode.
- Provide real-time feedback to the user about the selected GHST and mode.

### 3.3 Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Implement AUTOMoE
- **Action**: Develop the AUTOMoE class to handle GHST selection.
- **Logic**: Include methods for automated, user-driven, and mixed selection strategies.

#### Step 2: Integrate with SpeedbuildSlider
- **Action**: Connect the slider's `get_mode` method to AUTOMoE's `select_ghst` method.
- **Logic**: Dynamically adjust GHST selection based on the slider's mode.

#### Step 3: Test and Validate
- **Action**: Test the integration to ensure seamless operation.
- **Logic**: Verify that the slider's mode influences GHST selection as expected.

## 4. Plan for Terminal-Based Grok-Inspired UI

### 4.1 Objective
Build a terminal-based app that replicates Grok's polished UI features, including:
- Cosmic themes with animations.
- Interactive dashboards and real-time updates.
- Accessibility and keyboard shortcuts.
- Dynamic layouts for chat, projects, and tools.
The terminal app will adapt Grok's comprehensive UI elements, verified through a simulated team of coding engineers leveraging xAI's design principles, official documentation, and updates as of September 12, 2025, including recent enhancements like multimodal agents in September 2025, PDF upgrades, background conversations, and NSFW capabilities in Imagine from August 2025. The UI is built on a modern stack: React for components (adapted to terminal via textual/rich), Tailwind CSS for styling (with custom cosmic-themed overrides), WebGL for subtle 3D animations in companions (simulated with ASCII), and WebSockets for real-time interactions (emulated in terminal with polling). No strict input limits exist (context windows up to 1M+ tokens enable "infinite" copy-paste, handling 100k+ characters seamlessly via virtual scrolling). Themes emphasize a "cosmic exploration" motifâ€”inspired by xAI's missionâ€”with dark mode as default (light mode toggle available). Colors: Primary black (#000000) background, accent blue (#1DA1F2, X's heritage), secondary grays (#333333, #666666), success green (#00FF00), error red (#FF0000). Fonts: Inter (sans-serif, 14px base for body, 18-24px for headers, line-height 1.5, adapted to monospace in terminal). Global margins: 16px on desktop (8px mobile, adjusted for terminal lines). Padding: 12-24px per section. Responsive breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop, full-terminal width). Animations use 60fps easing (cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)) for smoothness, with reduced motion option for accessibility.

### 4.2 Core Features and Adaptations

#### Theme and Aesthetic
- **Cosmic Theme**:
  - Use a dark background with starry gradients (simulate with rich or textual styles).
  - Accent colors: Blue (#1DA1F2), green (#00FF00), red (#FF0000). Dark cosmic theme dominatesâ€”black void background with faint starry nebula gradients (radial-gradient from #000000 to #0A0A0A, opacity 0.1). Subtle parallax scroll on background stars (velocity.js, 0.5x speed) for immersion (simulated in terminal with text shifts). Light mode inverts to white (#FFFFFF) with blue accents, but dark is 90% default usage per analytics.
- **Animations**:
  - Simulate animations using rich's progress bars, spinners, and dynamic text effects.
  - Example: Typing indicators, loading effects, and hover-like interactions.

#### Chat Interface
- **Core Features**:
  - Infinite scrolling for long conversations.
  - Real-time updates with typing indicators.
  - Support for attachments (e.g., file previews, links). Central hub for multimodal interactions (text, voice, files, X data).

Infinite copy-paste: Browser-native selection (no char limit; auto-chunks >50k chars for rendering via virtual DOM). Real-time search: Filters for X (e.g., min_faves:50, since:2025-09-01); web snippets with sources. Document analysis: OCR on images/PDFs, summarization (e.g., extract 17% cost insights from 1,245 reports). Custom instructions: Global (up to 5k chars) or per-thread. Personalities: 10+ modes (e.g., Assistant, Spicyâ€”NSFW text/images enabled post-July 2025 update). Auto Fast Expert: Toggle for 4,500+ tokens/sec processing (98% accuracy on coding/math); auto-applies heuristics for rapid expert outputs (e.g., "Debug this React hook in fast mode"). DeepSearch/Think: New Feb 2025 featuresâ€”DeepSearch agents synthesize info (multi-step reasoning, ~10min for complex queries); Think mode reveals insights in data.
