### 📘 How to Use This Handbook

- **Glossy White Background:** For best results, use a Markdown viewer or documentation site with a white/light theme.
- **Emoji Accents:** Each Ghost agent’s role is visually marked for quick reference.
- **Professional Layout:** Teams are grouped for parallel collaboration, with cross-team links for synergy.

---

> **Tip:** Copy the Mermaid code above into your documentation or a Markdown file. Use a viewer that supports Mermaid diagrams (like VS Code with the Markdown Preview Mermaid plugin) for a beautiful, interactive flow chart.
