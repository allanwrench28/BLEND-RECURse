# GHST Ecosystem Standardized Rules

## Council Rule: Order of Operations
All branches must follow the council-driven Order of Operations:
- Council sets clear goals and timelines for each branch.
- Council extrapolates a 5-year roadmap for the ecosystem, with milestones and feedback loops.
- Infinite syncing: All branches and agents continuously share progress, feedback, and ideas.
- System is highly automated and creative—anyone can trigger and a brilliant app or feature pops up.

## Council Rule: Branch Isolation with Specialty Data Sharing
Branches must not infect or overwrite each other’s code or data.
However, branches can pull data, expertise, or specialty services from one another as needed (e.g., AI ghost PhD liaison, foreign exchange ghost).
This enables safe, modular collaboration and cross-branch innovation without risk of unwanted changes or conflicts.

## Council Rule: Roadmap Adherence & Evolutionary Feedback
All branches must strictly follow the council-defined roadmap and order of operations—no veering off course.
An automated feedback loop will guide the software’s evolution, adapting goals and features as time goes on (like a living creature).
Every engine and interface must be robust and forgiving, allowing users to type or interact in any style (even "caveman" typing, Copilot-level tolerance).

This rule ensures transparent, goal-driven development and continuous improvement across the GHST ecosystem.

## Other Standardized Rules
- Log all council actions, votes, and decisions for machine learning.
- Require council-driven decision-making for naming, architecture, and automation.
- Automate code maintenance, error fixing, and meta-level advice.
- Modularize the core for branch-based specialization and easy integration.
- Ensure all major actions and policies are logged for ML training and review.
- Use descriptive naming conventions and maintain clear documentation.
- Scaffold new features in dedicated branches with council oversight.
- Maintain automated workflows for dependency management, vulnerability scanning, and cross-platform builds.
- Customize UI and prompts to reflect council themes and ghostly personas.
- Continuously improve through recursive feedback loops and council brainstorming.
