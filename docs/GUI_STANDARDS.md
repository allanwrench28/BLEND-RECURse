# KlipperScreen-Inspired Python GUI Standards

## General Principles
- Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for separation of concerns.
- Ensure responsive layout for different screen sizes.
- Use consistent color schemes and fonts to enhance usability.

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for variable and function names.
- Use CamelCase for class names.

## Widget Usage
- Prefer using high-level widgets that encapsulate functionality.
- Group related widgets in containers (e.g., Box, Grid).

## Event Handling
- Define event handlers in a modular way.
- Avoid long-running tasks in the main thread; use asynchronous methods where necessary.

## Accessibility
- Ensure that the GUI is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Provide keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Testing
- Implement unit tests for critical components.
- Use automated testing tools to verify GUI behavior.
