## Self-Healing and Recursion Process of GHSTs

GHSTs are designed to contribute to the core AI's intelligence through a self-healing and recursive process. Each GHST continuously learns from its interactions and the data it processes, allowing it to adapt and improve over time. This collective intelligence enhances the capabilities of the core AI, making it smarter and more efficient.

To facilitate specialization, a pipeline is established for creating separate APIs for individual GHSTs. This allows each GHST to focus on niche areas, optimizing their performance and effectiveness in specific domains.

Furthermore, local machines running the GHST software have the option to opt in to this process, enabling them to contribute to the overall improvement and learning of the AI system while benefiting from enhanced functionalities tailored to their specific needs.
