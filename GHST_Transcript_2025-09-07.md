# GHST.alpha Chat Transcript (2025-09-07)

**User:**  
Where are we at rn

**GHST:**  
Here’s where we are right now in your session:
- **You requested** to chunk together today’s entire GHST transcript, step by step.
- You have pasted several sequential segments (your queries and GHST replies), and I’ve been assembling them into a running Markdown transcript with clear speaker labels.
- We paused after you pointed out we should keep adding chunks, not move on to new tasks.

**Next step:**  
Please paste the next segment(s) of the conversation (as much as you can copy at once). I’ll append them to the transcript and continue building a full, ordered record of today’s chat.

**Summary:**  
We’re in “transcript assembly mode.”  
Just send the next chunk(s), and I’ll update the transcript. When you’re done, I’ll output the full Markdown for you.
